===============================

Students should use this rubric: https://www.udacity.com/course/viewer#!/c-ud015/l-3072058665/m-3072588797   ...for self-checking their submission.


Instructions:
	Double click on the index.html file in the Pseudo Frogger Game folder to start the game.
	Use the c key to scroll through available characters.
	Move your char up to across the grass, avoiding the bugs, to cross the bridge.
	If a bug touches you, you will lose a life and be sent back.
	You must get to the bridge to continue. if you hit the water you will lose a life.
	You can score points by collecting (touching) the gems and add lives by collecting hearts.
	If you touch a stone you will lose points.

Controls:
	Arrow Up to move your character up.
	Arrow right or left to move right or left.
	Arrow down to move back down.
	Use the p key to pause.
	Use the q key to quit.

Option:
	You can copy or move the short cut (the icon with the arrow) to your desk top 
	for easy access to the game.

Note to all: I found the Lynda.com video called Foundations of Programming Fundamentals a very 
	helpful. it uses JavaScript as the example. Also JavaScript Essential Training.
